# ydkjs-code-listings
In this repo you can find customized code listings of Async &amp; Performance book from You don't know JS series

While reading the series of YDKJS books, started also practicing most of the code listings while also customizing them trying to understand as much as I could.

The code listings are separated on folders by the book name.
